Marketing Strategy Meeting - Q4 Planning
Date: September 18, 2025
Attendees: Sarah (Marketing Director), John (Product Manager), Alice (Dev Lead), Bob (Sales Manager)

Sarah: Let's review our Q4 marketing strategy. We need to focus on customer acquisition.

John: The new product features will be ready by October 15th. We should align our campaigns with that.

Decision: We will launch the new campaign on October 16th to coincide with product release.

Alice: The development team will need two additional weeks for testing. I think there might be some integration issues.

Risk: Potential integration issues could delay the product launch.

Sarah: That's concerning. Bob, what's your take on pushing the sales targets?

Bob: I think we can still meet Q4 targets if we launch by November 1st at the latest.

Decision: Maximum launch delay acceptable is November 1st.

Action: Alice will coordinate with QA team for comprehensive testing.

John: I'll update the product roadmap to reflect these timelines.

Action: John will revise the product roadmap by September 25th.

Alice will handle the technical documentation updates.

Sarah: Perfect. Let's also consider the budget implications.

Risk: Extended testing period will increase development costs by approximately 15%.

Action: Sarah will present revised budget to executive team.

Meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM.
