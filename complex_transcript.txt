Product Development Sprint Planning Meeting
Date: September 18, 2025
Time: 2:00 PM - 3:30 PM
Location: Conference Room A
Attendees: Sarah Chen (Product Manager), Dr. Michael Rodriguez (Engineering Lead), Alice Johnson (QA Lead), Bob Wilson (DevOps), Charlie Brown (UX Designer), Diana Prince (Security Officer)

[2:00 PM] Sarah Chen: Good afternoon everyone. Let's kick off our sprint planning for the authentication module. We have a lot to cover today.

[2:02 PM] Dr. Michael Rodriguez: Thanks Sarah. The current authentication system has several vulnerabilities that need immediate attention. Our priority should be implementing OAuth 2.0 with PKCE.

[2:03 PM] Alice Johnson: I agree with Michael. The QA team has identified 15 critical security issues in the current implementation. We need to address these before the next release.

Decision: We will prioritize OAuth 2.0 implementation with PKCE for enhanced security.

[2:05 PM] Charlie Brown: From a UX perspective, the new authentication flow should be seamless. Users shouldn't notice the security improvements. The login page needs to be redesigned to accommodate the new OAuth flow.

Action: Charlie Brown will create wireframes for the new OAuth login experience by Friday.

[2:07 PM] Bob Wilson: On the infrastructure side, we'll need to set up new Redis clusters for session management. The current single-node setup won't handle the increased load.

Risk: Redis cluster setup might introduce latency issues during peak hours.

[2:09 PM] Diana Prince: Security-wise, we need to implement proper token rotation and refresh mechanisms. Also, we should add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

Action: Diana Prince will review and approve the security implementation before deployment.

[2:11 PM] Dr. Michael Rodriguez: The engineering team estimates 3 weeks for the core OAuth implementation. We'll need additional time for testing and integration.

Decision: Sprint duration will be extended to 4 weeks to accommodate security requirements.

[2:13 PM] Sarah Chen: That's reasonable. Now let's talk about the mobile app integration. The iOS and Android teams need to update their SDKs.

Action: iOS and Android development teams will update their authentication SDKs within the first two weeks of the sprint.

[2:15 PM] Alice Johnson: The QA team will need to create comprehensive test cases for the new authentication flows. This includes edge cases like network interruptions and token expiration.

Action: Alice Johnson will coordinate with the development teams to create automated test suites.

[2:17 PM] Bob Wilson: For deployment, we'll implement blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime. The DevOps team will handle the infrastructure provisioning.

Risk: Blue-green deployment might require additional cloud resources, increasing costs by approximately 20%.

[2:19 PM] Charlie Brown: The user onboarding flow needs to be updated to include the new authentication steps. We should also consider progressive enhancement for existing users.

Action: Charlie Brown will design the updated onboarding flow and create a migration path for existing users.

[2:21 PM] Diana Prince: We need to ensure GDPR compliance with the new data handling requirements. The authentication system will collect additional user metadata.

Risk: GDPR compliance requirements might delay the launch if not addressed properly.

[2:23 PM] Dr. Michael Rodriguez: The backend API changes will require updates to our microservices architecture. Services A, B, and C will need modifications.

Action: Backend engineering team will update microservices A, B, and C to support OAuth tokens.

[2:25 PM] Sarah Chen: Let's discuss the timeline. We have stakeholders expecting a demo by the end of October.

Decision: Project timeline will be adjusted to ensure demo readiness by October 31st.

[2:27 PM] Alice Johnson: The QA team will need access to staging environments for early testing. We should set this up by next Monday.

Action: Bob Wilson will provision staging environments for QA testing by Monday.

[2:29 PM] Bob Wilson: Infrastructure-wise, we'll need to upgrade our load balancers to handle the increased authentication traffic.

Risk: Load balancer upgrades might cause temporary service degradation during the maintenance window.

[2:31 PM] Charlie Brown: The design system needs to be updated to include new authentication-related components. This includes error states and loading indicators.

Action: UX team will update the design system with authentication components.

[2:33 PM] Diana Prince: We should implement audit logging for all authentication events. This is crucial for compliance and security monitoring.

Action: Security team will implement comprehensive audit logging for authentication events.

[2:35 PM] Dr. Michael Rodriguez: The database schema will need modifications to store OAuth tokens and refresh tokens securely.

Action: Database team will design and implement secure token storage schema.

[2:37 PM] Sarah Chen: Excellent work everyone. I think we have a comprehensive plan. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting next week to track progress.

Decision: Follow-up meeting will be scheduled for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM.

[2:39 PM] Meeting adjourned.
