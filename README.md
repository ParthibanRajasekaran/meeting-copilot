# Meeting Copilot

A real-time meeting summarization agent built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

Copyright 2025. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

**IMPORTANT:** This project requires a Google API key for operation. For security reasons:

- **NEVER** hard-code API keys in source code
- **NEVER** commit API keys to version control
- **NEVER** share API keys in any form
- Only pass API keys via command line arguments or environment variables
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent accidental commits of secrets

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual API key (remember: .env is gitignored)
   ```

## API Key Setup

To use this agent, you need a Google Gemini API key.

1. Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or [Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

2. **Secure Methods to Provide the API Key:**

   **Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   python -m meeting_copilot.agent transcript.txt
   ```

   **Option B: Command Line Argument**
   ```bash
   python -m meeting_copilot.agent transcript.txt --api-key "your-api-key-here"
   ```

### üö® Security Best Practices

- **Never** store API keys in files that could be committed to version control
- **Never** hard-code API keys in source code
- **Never** share API keys in emails, chat, or documentation
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API key usage for unauthorized access

The project includes a `.env.example` file to show required environment variables, but **never** commit actual `.env` files containing real API keys.

The project is configured to prevent accidental commits of API keys through the `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

### Interactive NLP Mode (Recommended)

For the best experience, use the interactive NLP mode where you can ask questions about meetings in natural language:

```bash
python -m meeting_copilot.agent --interactive
```

**Interactive Mode Features:**
- Load transcript files dynamically
- Ask questions in natural language
- Get specific information (decisions, action items, owners, risks)
- Conversational AI-powered responses

**Example Interactive Session:**
```
ü§ñ Meeting Copilot - Interactive Mode
==================================================
You can now ask questions about meetings in natural language!
Commands:
  /load <file>  - Load a transcript file
  /quit         - Exit interactive mode
  /help         - Show this help

You: /load sample_transcript.txt
‚úÖ Loaded transcript from sample_transcript.txt

You: What decisions were made in this meeting?
ü§î Thinking...

ü§ñ Meeting Copilot: Based on the meeting transcript, the following decisions were made:
‚Ä¢ We will extend the deadline by two weeks.

You: Who is responsible for updating the documentation?
ü§î Thinking...

ü§ñ Meeting Copilot: Sarah is responsible for updating the documentation according to the action items.

You: /quit
Goodbye! üëã
```

### Command Line File Processing

Run the agent on a specific transcript file:

```bash
python -m meeting_copilot.agent path/to/transcript.txt
```

Or with API key option:

```bash
python -m meeting_copilot.agent path/to/transcript.txt --api-key "your-api-key-here"
```

The agent will process the transcript and print a structured summary including decisions, action items, owners, and risks.

**Example:**

```bash
python -m meeting_copilot.agent sample_transcript.txt --api-key "your-key"
```

Output:
```
Meeting Summary:
Summary: Overall summary of the meeting based on transcript.
Decisions: ['We will extend the deadline by two weeks.']
Action Items: ['Sarah will update the documentation.']
Owners: ['Alice']
Risks: ['There might be budget overruns.']
```

**Note:** The system includes intelligent fallback functionality. If the ADK agent encounters issues, it will automatically fall back to direct heuristic processing to ensure you always get results.

## üß™ Testing & CI/CD

### **Cost-Optimized Testing Strategy**

The project uses a **dual-workflow approach** to balance development velocity with cost control:

#### **1. Daily CI Workflow** (FREE - Runs on every push/PR)
- **Trigger**: Push to main, pull requests
- **Cost**: $0.00 (heuristic processing only)
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback, code quality, no API usage
- **Coverage**: Unit tests, integration tests

#### **2. Monthly Comprehensive Workflow** (Optional - Minimal cost)
- **Trigger**: 1st of every month (scheduled) OR manual
- **Cost**: Minimal (free tier covers)
- **Purpose**: Full AI agent validation
- **Coverage**: AI functionality, performance tests

#### **3. Manual Comprehensive Workflow** (On-demand)
- **Trigger**: Manual from GitHub UI
- **Cost**: Controlled by user
- **Purpose**: Custom testing scenarios
- **Options**: Full test, AI-only, or performance tests

### **Running Tests**

#### **Local Testing** (Free)
```bash
# Run all tests locally (no API costs)
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=meeting_copilot
```

#### **Manual Comprehensive Testing** (Controlled cost)
1. Go to **GitHub ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Manual Comprehensive Test**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**
3. Select test type: `full`, `ai-only`, or `performance`
4. Click **"Run workflow"**

### **Cost Analysis**

| Workflow | Frequency | API Usage | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Daily CI** | Every push/PR | None | **$0.00** |
| **Monthly Comprehensive** | 1st of month | Minimal | **$0.00** (free tier) |
| **Manual Comprehensive** | As needed | Variable | **User controlled** |

### **Why This Approach?**

‚úÖ **Development stays fast** - No waiting for AI API calls during development
‚úÖ **Costs are controlled** - AI usage only when explicitly requested  
‚úÖ **Quality is maintained** - Comprehensive testing available when needed
‚úÖ **Free tier optimized** - Minimal API usage stays within free limits
